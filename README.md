# AI-Integrated Certificate Verification System

## Overview
The AI-Integrated Certificate Verification System automates credential authentication using OCR, NLP, and fraud detection, ensuring secure and instant validation via QR codes. Built with React, Flask, and Firebase, it offers a user-friendly interface for students, institutions, and employers. The system enhances security by preventing certificate fraud, reducing manual verification efforts, and enabling real-time validation.

## Features
- **Automated Certificate Verification** – Extracts and verifies certificate details using OCR and NLP.
- **Fraud Detection** – Identifies anomalies in fonts, layouts, and metadata.
- **Instant QR Code Validation** – Enables quick verification via certificate ID or QR scan.
- **User-Friendly Dashboards** – Separate portals for students, institutions, and employers.
- **Secure Storage & Management** – Uses Firebase Firestore and Cloud Storage for efficient data handling.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React (for user interface)
- **Backend**: Flask (for server-side logic)
- **Database & Storage**: Firebase Firestore (for structured data) and Cloud Storage (for file management)
- **OCR**: Tesseract (for text extraction from images/PDFs)
- **NLP**: Spacy (for text verification and analysis)

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js & npm (for frontend)
- Python & pip (for backend)
- Firebase account (for database & storage setup)

### Setup
#### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-certificate-verification.git
cd ai-certificate-verification
```

#### Backend Setup (Flask)
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

#### Frontend Setup (React)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## API Endpoints
- `POST /upload` – Uploads and verifies a certificate.
- `GET /verify/<certificate_id>` – Fetches certificate details.
- `POST /issue` – Institutions issue new certificates.
- `POST /fraud-detection` – Analyzes a certificate for fraud.

## Deployment
- **Backend**: Deploy Flask app on Heroku/AWS/GCP.
- **Frontend**: Deploy React app on Firebase Hosting/Netlify/Vercel.
- **Database**: Use Firebase Firestore and Cloud Storage.

## Usage
1. **Students** upload certificates and receive verification results.
2. **Institutions** issue and manage certificates.
3. **Employers** verify certificates via certificate ID or QR code.
